# Sublime SDF

Please forgive how bad the code is. I was focused on getting it out quickly more than making it look pretty. Making it prettier will be a priority after official release.

If you find any bugs, feel free to report them in the issues section of github.

This plugin requires you to install the SDFCLI tool from NetSuite.

# Windows
Install via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)
```bash
choco install sdfcli
```

# Mac
Install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
```bash
brew cask install java # Unless you already have Java installed
brew install limebox/netsuite/sdfcli
```
